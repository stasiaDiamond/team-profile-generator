# team-profile-generator

## Description

App generates a team roster by utilizing CLI inquirer prompts. This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The challenge was also to create modularized constructor files directly from a test suite. There was starter code in the test files and generate.html file, so my code had to fit seamlessly.

## Installation

node.js, npm, VS Code, inquirer, and browser required

## Usage

Initialize by entering node index.js into your Integrated VS Code Terminal
